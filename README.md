- `MainLeftBar.tsx`: handles inputs, directs data fetching, and changes data states in `MainPage.tsx`
- `BottomBar.tsx`: formats the focus information from `focus_reqs.ts`
- `actions.tsx`: is a Next.js server actions file  with functions that fetches prereq tree data from the live Flask API
- `focus_reqs.ts`: is a storage of CS Focus requirements in variables
