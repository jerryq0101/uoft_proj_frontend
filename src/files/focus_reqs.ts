const ai_major_desc = "The Focus in Artificial Intelligence (Major) has the same set of requirements as the Focus in Artificial Intelligence (Specialist). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is aimed at understanding and replicating the computational processes underlying intelligent behaviour. These behaviours include the perception of one's environment, learning how that environment is structured, communicating with other agents, and reasoning to guide one's actions. This focus is designed to provide students with an introduction to some of the key scientific and technical ideas that have been developed in AI. There are four different sub-areas of AI represented in our department: Computer Vision, Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. These areas cover a wide variety of ideas and techniques. Students wanting to achieve this focus are required to take courses from at least two of these sub-areas (as in point 2, below)."
